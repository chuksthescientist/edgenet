Shoe Image Classifier

The goal of the project was to build a demo image classification application for EdgeNet that can take as input an image, classify it and then perform some additional operations based on the classification.

The tasks are limited to building the classification model and wrapping it into a function, such that it is very easy to invoke this function by the additional API and web components that will be built in the future.
